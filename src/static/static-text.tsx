export const introText = "Hey! Thanks for checking out my website. It's a little barren right now but I'm hoping to upload some blog posts and projects I've worked on soon. The frontend here is pure React with Typescript and the blogs & portfolios are obtained through a Ruby on Rails API. This should let me update the website with relative ease without going through code. On a final note, I've always been a big fan of a light/dark mode feature so I've added it to this website. You can toggle it through the button in the top-left. It was accomplished through a combination of a custom localStorage hook I made with a globalStyles component injecting styles throughout the whole DOM tree. It should make the site a lot easier on the eyes depending on your preference.";
