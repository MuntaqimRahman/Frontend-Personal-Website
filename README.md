# Frontend-Personal-Website
Typescript React Frontend of my Personal Website

Backend API stores all the dynamic data seen on the website (E.g projects, blogs, activities, experience etc.) This makes it easy to keep my website
updated without altering this frontend code.

It has a dark mode feature which stores your selection in localStorage using my own React hook and pulls data from a Ruby on Rails API I've made.

You can see it hosted here https://muntaqim-website-frontend.herokuapp.com/

I aim to add a domain at a time in the future once more content is uploaded to it. Note I've allowed Heroku to let my application sleep when not called on to save
resources. This may mean it will load slowly the first time you go onto it before Heroku wakes it up.
