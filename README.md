# Frontend-Personal-Website
Typescript React Frontend of my Personal Website

Backend API stores all the dynamic data seen on the website (E.g projects, blogs, activities, experience etc.) This makes it easy to keep my website
updated without altering this frontend code.

You can see it hosted here https://muntaqim-website-frontend.herokuapp.com/

I aim to add a domain at a time in the future once more content is uploaded to it.
